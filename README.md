Internet Explorer was for many years the default web browser for the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. Microsoft has discontinued Internet Explorer and still maintains IE 11. Microsoft Edge replaced IE as the Windows default browser beginning with Windows 10, but IE is still a popular browser for people running older versions of windows.

## About Internet Explorer

Microsoft Internet Explorer contains various internet connection, network file sharing, Active Scripting, and security settings. Among other features, Internet Explorer supports:

* Proxy server configuration
* VPN and FTP client capabilities
* Remote administration

Internet Explorer received much publicity for several network security holes that were discovered in the past, but newer releases of the browser strengthened the browser's security features to fight phishing and malware. Internet Explorer was the most popular web browser in use worldwide for many years â€” from 1999 when it surpassed Netscape Navigator until 2012 when Chrome became the most popular browser. Even now, it is used by a lot of Windows users, though less than Microsoft Edge and Chrome. Because of its popularity, it is a popular target of malware.

## How to Open Internet Explorer 11 With Cortana?

If you have Cortana enabled, there's an easier way to launch Internet Explorer in Windows 10.

Say, "Hey, Cortana."
Say, "Open Internet Explorer."

As long as Cortana is set up correctly, and can understand the command, Internet Explorer opens as soon as you ask.

## How to Download and Update Internet Explorer?

* Go to Microsoft's Internet Explorer download page.
* Locate your language from the list on their site (English, for example).
* Then choose either the 32-bit or 64-bit link to get that version for your computer. If you're not sure which download link to choose, find out which version of Windows is installed on your computer.
* When the installation files finish downloading, Internet Explorer updates (or upgrades) automatically, and keeps your favorites, cookies, form history, and saved passwords intact.
